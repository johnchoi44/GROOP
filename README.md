# GROOP

⭐ Project Name: GROOP
💡 Description: A real-time messaging web platform that uses Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Firebase, which match people based on their MBTI and interests. Generative AI is used to generate an icebreaker to start the conversation in the chatroom. The matching algorithm is further improved by our own trained sentiment analysis model from text feedbacks from users.

🏆 With this project, we were able to secure 2nd place overall, 2nd place in Nittany AI category, and Best Use of Google Cloud in HackPSU

🧑🏻‍💻 HackPSU is Penn State’s hackathon with over 500 students for 24 hours of creation, innovation, and fun.
